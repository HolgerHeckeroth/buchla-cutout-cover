# Buchla Cutout Cover

A 3D printable cover for the cutout in the bottom of Buchla boats.

## What is it good for

This is a 3d printable cover for the cutouts in the bottom of Buchla boats. I just like the idea of really closing the hole and having a flat underside of the boat other than with metal plates.
Most importantly it's DIY.

## Compatability

I only checked the fit with boats made by [SAModular](https://www.samodular.com/), so far.

## How to print

The print settings are not that special. Others should work, too.

- Layer height: 0.2-0.3mm
- Nozzle diameter: 0.4mm

## Assembly Instructions

Put the cover into the cutout from the inside of the boat.
Fasten with 4 M3 6mm screws. The holes in the cover have a diameter of 2.8mm so an M3 screw while hold in it. Of course you can use longer screws an secure them with a nut.
